# -Bone-Fracture-Prediction-
: Developed a binary image classification model leveraging transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet-50  architecture using pytorch. The model was trained to classify images into two categories by fine-tuning the final layers while freezing the rest of the network to retain learned features from large-scale ImageNet data.
